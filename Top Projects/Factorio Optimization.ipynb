    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer game Factorio involves building a factory to collect resources, process them, and combine them into other objects. In the same vein as other games such as Minecraft, the goal is to ramp up the complexity of what you are combining to reach higher tiers of objects. A key difference between Factorio and other games is its focus on automating the process rather than collecting resources. A good amount of the game is dedicated to optimizing your factories and layouts to produce resources as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, say you decided on a 3x3 grid for your factory you wish to use optimally. You have mining machines, smelters, conveyor belts to transport resources between machines and a chest you wish to place the smelted metal in.  You know which spaces in the grid contain metals to mine and which do not.  Given that you know how fast the mining machine and smelters can operate (mining machines produce more material than a smelter can handle) how do you lay out your factory to maximize the smelted material you produce?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project models a simplified version of the Factorio game and optimize the factory layout.  Given the online community a number of projects already exist to [calculate general resource requirements](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html#items=advanced-circuit:f:1) given a target and [example layouts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754378586) that scale well as your factory grows.  Our focus is instead on optimizing modular sections of the factory that come up in most designs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the problem clear, we present a simple example. For our simplified version of the game, a scenario may involve a 5 by 3 grid with resources along only the top edge of the map.  Hence our resource distribution for this scenario would be:\n",

    "|0 |0 |0 |0 |0|\n",
    "\n",
    "We have mining machines that we can place on the map that each take up one space and face any direction.  These feed whatever resources they mine out in the direction they face. We can expect an optimal layout on the resources above to have a mining machine on each of the spots having resources. Other mining machines do not accept resources onto their space, so the only way to get the resources they mine onto another space would be facing down.  We refer to buildings on the map by a one letter code for their type followed by a single letter indicating their direction. A mining machine would be \"m\" and the direction facing down as \"d\".  Hence a mining machine facing down would be designated \"md\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we would expect the optimal placement of miners to look something the grid below.  (With . representing an empty space)\n",

    "From here we are feeding resources from the first row into the second.  However, we want to collect the resources into a storage chest.  If we place this chest in front of one of the mining machines it will start collecting resources.  We call a chest \"h\" and it doesn't have a direction.  Let's put it on the map!\n",

    "This is great since we are now collecting resources from the right most mining machine into the chest.  However, we have four other mining machines with resources that aren't reaching the chest.  Let's build some conveyor belts to cary the resources from the mining machine to the chest.  Conveyors accept resources entering their space from any direction and will push them all to the next space in the direction they face.  We will call conveyors \"c\" and in this case they will face to the right and hence have a direction \"r\".\n",

    "On this map we can't do much better since there aren't any more resources.  On more complicated resource distributions many interesting factors come into play.  For instance, imagine if conveyor belts could only carry 3 resources.  This would be a problem because the rightmost conveyor needs to carry 4 resources from the 4 mining machines it connects to the chest.  To solve this, we may need to add more conveyors!\n",

    "In this more complicated solution we route three of the resources down and back up into the chest so that no conveyor needs to carry more than 3 resources.  (\"d\" is facing down, \"r\" is facing right, and \"u\" is facing up.)\n",

    "## 2. Mathematical model ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an introduction to our topic, we will break down the model we are using to analyze the topic. The model itself is a variation of a network flow linear program. We will begin by creating a square map using a Gaussian distribution function. To make the model as basic as possible, we found parameters we could implement to simply create a map where every space provides an equal number of resources (to make this simple, we'll just use 1 as the resource value). \n",
    "\n",
    "We have a decision to make for each node/space on the map. We can place nothing on a space, or we can place a miner, conveyor, or a chest. More specifically, the miners and conveyors must be given a specific direction to decide which direction they will carry the resource to. So our decision is to decide for each space on the map, whether to do nothing, place a chest, a miner (and if so, in which direction), or a conveyor (and if so, in which direction). This comes to 10 possible building options. \n",
    "\n",
    "To represent this process, we use a matrix the same size as the map, with each element of the matrix representing a variable at a specific spot on the map: \n",
    "\n",
    "1-10: A binary variable for each building type representing whether or not that building type will be used in the corresponding space on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "11: A variable for chests, representing how many resources flow into a chest at the corresponding location on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "12-15: A variable for each direction of miner, representing how many resources will be mined at the corresponding location on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "16-19: A variable for each direction of conveyor, representing how many resources will be transferred at the corresponding location on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this model work in the way that we would like, we have many constraints we must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Balance constraint: The flow out must equal the flow in at each node for a network flow problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: We must limit the chest contents to zero for each space that is not a chest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-6: A miner has a limit on production in each direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7-10: A conveyor has a capacity limit in each direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "11-14: We must create a buffer at each edge of the map to ensure there is no flow from a space on the map to a space          off the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "15: We constrain the maximum number of buildings of each type. These values come from a parameter introduced before       the variables and constraints are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "16: There can only be one building in each space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to maximize the total flow of resources into chests. Another factor we include in the objective function is the cost, which is insignificant to us in the context of our problem, but will hold a very slight weight in our analysis. The reason for this inclusion of cost in the objective is to ensure that if we do not increase flow into a chest, then we will simply do nothing with a space. For example, if we have already maximized the capacity of conveyors surrounding a chest with spots to fill, we would simply do nothing with the remaining spaces. We can ensure the model performs this step correctly by introducing a cost for each machine, while assigning no cost to the option of \"do nothing\". Cost could potentially be a factor to explore in the future, with a Pareto tradeoff analysis in which we change the parameter to increase the weight that cost holds in the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are many parameters we introduce in this model in order to do a proper sensitivity analysis and to organize the model in a presentable format. We must first build the resource distribution map before introducing the variables, and introduce some parameters that affect different factors of the model. We will explore the impact that changing some of these parameters can have on the overall result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the model written out in standard form. The model is more intuitive with some of the variables on the right hand side of the constraints, especially the balance constraint, which you can see in the code. One important note is that there are a few parameters used in the constraints. We can assume for our purposes that these are values that have already been defined, which validates our model. In our actual model, we will define these parameter values before running through the model. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing we will do in our model is introduce parameters and set up the map. There are many scenarios that we will run through to get an understanding of how sensitive our model is to the parameters we use. There are many possible scenarios to run through involving the size and distribution of the map as well as the characteristics of the buildings, but we will choose some of the scenarios we found to be most interesting and insightful. We will isolate each of these cases to display the clear effect that each of these specific demonstrations has, though we found that there are many combinations of changes in parameters that would be interesting for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use various map sizes depending on the scenario we intend to evaluate. We start with a map size of three for the basic scenario. The miner speed and conveyor speed represent the maximum capacity that each direction of miner and conveyor can operate at relative to the resource amount. As a result, conveyors can carry a maximum of six total resources at one time, given that a miner mines one resource in the same amount of time. We use an arbitrarily large number for maximum chest contents, given that we would like to maximize the number of resources that flow into a chest. We will normally use one chest for each scenario, but will also evaluate the impact of increasing the number of chests in our results and discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a parameter that we will evaluate in which we throw noise into the probability distribution of the map. The next parameter is one that normalizes the distribution so that with all the other parameters, the map will simply be uniform, with one resource in each entry. We will eventually change this to introduce a true Gaussian probability distribution.\n",

If we take the sum of the entries of this matrix, we have our objective value (how many total resources we were able to store in a chest). The third will be the miner matrix, which will tell us how many resources each spot produces (in other words, which entries have a miner, and what capacity they are operating at).

Here we see that an extra 2 spaces produces approximately one extra resource.  When looking at an actual grid however, two miners can efficiently feed into a single conveyor.  Hence we originally expected this scaling to be much closer to 2/3 rather than 1/2.  It's interesting that the other factors such as geometric limitations cut into the production notably.\n",

For a smaller grid these two parts of the objective are much more correlated because changing a building to minimize cost will almost certainly affect the output.\n",

This means adding a second chest significantly affects the efficiency of the operation.\n",

    "In this scenario, we set the parameters to create a true Gaussian distribution function to set the map, setting the mean in the middle of the map, the standard deviations at 1, creating no noise, and keeping building speeds at their standard value. Our results are fairly predictable. The miners are placed in the middle two rows, flowing outward to conveyors, which all flow toward a chest at the bottom right edge of the map.\n",

    "One interesting future point of analysis could be to adjust the price of certain directions of miners and conveyors. An applicable use of this could be that you are given financial incentive to build in a certain direction due to an outside factor, such as getting closer to a valuable resource (for financial gain or our necessity; for example, gold or water). However, there is plenty of analysis to be done by adjusting other parameters that simply relate to flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.B.2 Corner Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we push the higher values of the Gaussian distribution to the bottom right corner of the map. This causes depletion of resources that are now farther from the new mean, especially in the top left corner. The goal is always to place the miners in the most resource rich area.\n",

The chest is placed in a resource rich place, blocking off potential resources, but this is necessary to prevent a cut-off from flow if we were to place it in the upper right corner. This scenario provides lots of potential for future analysis. With a concept of expanding that map or looking into different layouts, the mean of the Gaussian distribution has tremendous impact in where the miners are placed. Moving around the mean could make for some interesting potential analysis.\n",

    "In this scenario, we set the standard devation for x to 0.2. This compresses the distribution to a very small x range, so the resources are especially prevalent in the middle of the x region of the map, spread along the y-axis. Given this layout, the proper placement of the miners is in the middle two columns.\n",

    "#### 4.B.4 Noise Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we adjust the noise parameter. We set noise_param to 0.3, which means that as we run each entry through the Gaussian probability equation, its value is multiplied by a random percentage between 70 and 130. The nature of the parameters we have set for the Gaussian distribution is such that the middle of the map is heavily rich in resources compared to the edges. As a result, it would take a significant amount of random noise to lure the miners out of the middle. Noise is more likely to have an impact when combined with a change in other parameters. In addition, rather than creating a noise parameter in which we multiply each entry by a random percentage, it could be interesting to add noise to the probability of each entry. This would increase the likelihood of a miner being placed on an entry that would normally be an outlier with very low probability. In this scenario, we see that the bottom middle entries benefitted more from the noise parameter than the other entries surrounding the center did. As a result, there were two miners placed at the bottom. We could run this function again, and the same thing may happen on the upper, left, or right entries instead.\n",

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we found that optimizing the layout of a factory in Factorio was possible using Mixed Integer Programming.  We found the optimal layout of mining machines and conveyor belts in a number of situations.  More importantly, we found that in many situations there was no layout that could leverage all resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance in our model was not very high because it was a mixed integer problem. This was necessary because a given space could not be half a mining machine and half a chest. We briefly explored using an L1 regularization to encourage this instead of integer constraints, but we weren't successful in this attempt.  Getting this regularization approach to work instead of integer constraints would help considerably when scaling problems above 100 spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was particularly interesting because we just scratched the surface on what we could do.  We left a lot of the factorio game unexplored.  An important part of the game is combining given resources into others.  Our model does not reach this part since it focuses only on transporting the single resource.  While multiple resources do not necessarily add a lot of cognitive complexity, they do add a great deal of computational complexity because adding a second resource would nearly double our variables and constraints.  Our current solution takes a while to run even on a 10 by 10 grid, so doubling the complexity would likely hurt performance considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another future task that would bring our model closer to the actual game is allowing buildings to take multiple spaces on the map.  In the real game more advanced buildings tend to be larger.  For instance the typical mining machine is actually a 3 by 3 building.  This would be possible in a fairly simple way by constraining what buildings can be placed next to each other and adding building types for each section of the larger building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model as written also supports a lot of experiments we didn't actually run.  For instance we did not test what placement patterns with rectuangular shapes resulted in even though our model only needed small modifications to support it.  Another interesting question is what the tradeoff curve between the cost of a building and the resources it provides looks like.  This is important because in the game it limits how quickly you can expand the mining operation once it is deployed.  For instance, it may be more efficient to build a facility that pays itself off quickly rather than one that produces more but pays itself off slower due to a higher initial investment."
