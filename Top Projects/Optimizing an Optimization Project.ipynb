    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "This project will use optimization to explore the processes of creating an optimization project from start to finish. To accomplish this task, we will largely use applications of network flow, mixed-integer programming, and finally extend our model into general convex optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.a Description of the Problem\n",
    "The Intro-Opti Corporation (IOC) sells a luxury product marketed to students enrolled in ISyE 524 who need to finish their final project. IOC manufactures and sells a finished optimization project that the students may unethically turn in as their own work. In creating this product, IOC must complete a number of project subparts which are further divided into tasks. Recently, to meet student demand, the top brass at IOC are discussing a possible restructuring of the company in order to deliver their product as efficiently as possible. Using different optimization procedures, they hope to explore various  concerns relating to this endeavour. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.b History, Importance, Assumptions\n",
    "This project began by attempting to model the proccess by which a company (affiliated with Dolina) was commissioned to create products by its customers. With the goals of maximizing worker utilization and minimizing lead time, we set out to understand aspects of the problem and begin to model. Our original intention was to work with the concrete data provided by the company, however their data collection timeline ended up not lining up well with this project’s end date. We then decided to use the project itself as a source of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different models in this project relate to the [Minimum Cost Network Flow Problem](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.14.3.205). Network flow is an algorithmic paradigm that is able to model an astonishing number of problems, including longest/shortest path problems, matching problems, scheduling, project selection, and even image segmentation! The general idea is to transform the problem into a graph with nodes representing distinct entities, and edges between the nodes representing assignment of work hours, effort, units of a product, etc. Nodes can have supply and demand of the \"flow\" that they contribute to the overall problem. Edges between the nodes can have minimum and maximum capacities of flow. The goal is to send flow through the nodes in such a way that you satisfy the requirements of the system and thereby find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project also resembles assignment problems more generally. This is a classic subfield of optimization problems and comes up naturally elsewhere in applications such as in [auctions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijindorg.2006.10.002), [marriage matching](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.47.9.1252.9784), [scheduling classes to classrooms](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/12.4.307), and [assigning students to school districts](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803322157061). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the importance of this project is that the approaches and solutions developed here can be easily adapted to these other domains, by altering the relevant parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.c Report Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to this project will be to explore various facets of this problem using several models.\n",

    "* Time investment has a 1:1 relationship with partial credit\n",

    "* No components are stricty required (thas is, any task may be skipped without affectign other tasks, or the overall grade in some way\n",

    "* Determine the feasibility of all 4 group members being able to complete the project\n",
    "* Find permutations of possible ways to complete the project given an individual's strengths and time availability, and the possible costs and time requirements of different tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions\n",
    "* Time is flowing from source to sink\n",
    "* Nodes are for 4 group members, 21 tasks, and 6 subparts\n",
    "* Each node is balanced (that is, the amount of time entering into one node equals the amount of time going out from the node)\n",
    "* Each member has a maximum time to work for\n",
    "* Each task and subpart has a required time to complete\n",
    "\n",
    "*A longest path application, specifically project planning:*\n",
    "* Determine how long a project might take once we account for simultaneous completion of components and interdependent tasks\n",
    "\n",

    "* Tasks are interdependent\n",
    "* There are no cyclical dependencies \n",

    "This problem looks similar to another linear program, except for the nonlinearity in the second constraint. This suggests we should look at a broader class of optimization programs. Geometric programming is also appealing here, since the only nonlinearity are terms of the form $(x^{flow})^{-1}$. However, formulating the problem as a geometric program is not possible because of equalities involving both the variables that we wish perform the log-sum-exp trick on and variables that take on the value of zero (which we cannot perform the log-sum-exp trick on). As is well known, a convex nonlinear function cannot be involved in an equality constraint (since the negative of the function is concave).

    "In this section, we have a transportation model, except instead of the classic minimization of distance * cost, we have a maximization of grade achieved. Grade achieved is defined by the hours put in divided by the hours demanded (The assumption being that putting in half the time required on a section results in 50% of the reward) times the reward for that particular task. The constraints are <= instead of equalities, as would be normal for a transportation problem, because there is no requirement for balance. In fact, it's a more realistic model, because in real life, tasks are not binary (completed or not). It is very possible for a task to be partially completed. There also should not be any particular restriction that ensures any singular task must be completed (Though this could be explored as an extension to this project). There's also no reason to enforce an equality on supply, as maximizing the overall grade ensures that each person works their maximum hours, if possible."

    "There is a significant difference between this model of the transportation code and the previous. In this version, each individual is limited by specialization in certain tasks. That is, a person should only be able to complete certain tasks rather than sharing an identical skillset with the rest of the team, and by extension, sharing the entire task pool. Thus this data section includes lists of valid and invalid tasks for each individual. Do note: the list of valid tasks is unused. It's only present here in the data section for clarity purposes. "

The superior method of translating this task restriction into code is to enforce the contrapositive: ensure that no tasks which are invalid for a given person are completed by that person. This is done with lists of invalid tasks, and ensuring the sum of flow on each invalid task for each individual is 0. This results in extremely consise, modifiable code.  "

    "The following Julia model is for the network flow based on the section 2 math model. In this code, variables express all arcs in the flow. The flow starts from the source, which is providing the total hours (120h) that can be used for this project. The total time is divided among the 4 people in the following nodes, and each person can work for maximum of 30 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next arcs are connecting each person to all 21 tasks, and these tasks are separated to 6 subparts (intro, math, solution, results, conclusion, and aesthetics). As shown in the math model, each subpart has a required time component, and this is expressed in the constraints found in the code. In this model, it is assumed that each task should have a minimum required investment of 1 hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, each person has their own strengths, and each subpart consists of specified tasks. These dependencies are implemented by using constraints in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential part for creating the netwok flow model is creating balance for each node. In this model, the time entering into a node must be equal to the time leaving the node. This balance is expressed using constraints in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object of the network flow is to maximize the flow generated from the source (identical to maximizing the feedback flow from the sink to source). After we run this Julia model, a feasible (max flow 120h) result is obtained.\n",
    "The strength of the code is that we can easily change the model conditions. For example, if each person's strength was changed, we can realize the new situation by changing the parameter sets in the first part of the code. We can easily check whether the model is feasible or not by changing the parameters.\n"

    "Next, we continue defining the model by initializing a variable of length 72 representing the flow on each edge, and creating the balance constraint. Since we are solving this max flow model with a virtual edge, we set the supply/demand at each node to be 0. The other capacity constraints model the specifics of our problem. The edges between the source and divisions are capped at a flow of 30, since we do not want any division working more than 30 units of effort. Each edge between a task and its parent subpart has a minimum capacity of 1, so that we ensure at least 1 unit of effort is devote to it in the max flow. Similarly, the edges between the subparts and the sink have minimum capacities to model the minimum number of effort units we wish to flow through the subpart nodes."

    "This code is similar to that of the max flow model and longest path model. We still use the decision variables $x^{flow}$ and include all the constraints from the max flow model. The most important changes we have made are to use the dual variables from the interior maximization of the longest path model, $\\nu$, and rewrite the original cost function as a constraint and the original constraint as a cost function. The edge weights here a function of both the baseline edge weight and the amount of flow through the corresponding edge ($c/x^{flow}$). We also note here that we wrote out the constraints explicitly, because the solvers did not seem to recognize the problem as convex while it was in matrix form."

    "Both forms of code, despite the fact that the second has the aditional (fairly restrictive) constraint that limits group members to only being able to work on certain tasks, share extremely similar optimal values. It is surprisingly difficult to tinker with the arbitrary data values to create optimal values that are not identical. The original values were more reality-oriented and implied that each task would be worth approximately the same (4-5%) and each task would take approximately the same amount of time (1-3 hrs). It is extremely rare (I failed on every attempt) to pick reasonable values and have different resulting scores, even while heavily skewing tasks that were unique to a single person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, I would not have expected this to be the case, but I suppose it's because of of the wide scope of the \"specialization\". Each group member is able to preform 10/21 tasks, and due to random chance in selection, so very few tasks are unique. Additionally, because reasonable values for the difficulty and reward of these tasks fall into a narrow range, and there are so many of them, there are many optimal assignments. This means that it would take seriously unconventional data or unreasonably narrow skillsets (for a class project) to make a significant change. Thus, as the model stands, we can conclude that moderate specialization has little effect on the feasibility of a project. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's an extremely interesting application of this result:\n",
    "It's very doable to create a statistical function that describes the expected number of unique tasks. Using this function, it should be possible to derive an expression relating the degree of specialization (avg task proficiency / number of tasks) to the sensitivity of the objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why this is interesting: suppose you own a business where certain employees are specialized to tasks that are worth a certain amount of revenue. In cases where there's low crosstraining, certain individuals are huge liabilities for loss in the case of illness, quitting, and the like. That is, this concept could be an excellent way to model a business's [Bus Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)! This potential model would be a huge asset in risk management, revealing risky employees and identifying areas for crosstraining or hiring.  \n",

    "We wanted to see the change in optimal value by changing hours needed per task. Since each task has certain rewards points, changing the hours needed per task would change the optimal grade as our model will suggest us to work on those tasks that has higher grade value. Hence, for the same total hours needed, we could optimize our grade by working on the tasks that has the most reward.

    "#### Network flow model using arc variables\n",
    "By seeing results by the Julia code, we can understand the given network flow model and constraints give feasible solutions. Although maximum flow of this model can be 120h, there are several possible solutions for the amount of each arc. It is confirmed that this Julia code is working correctly by comparing the amount of each arc to given constraints. As mentioned in section 3, this model can easily change given conditions and constraints by adjusting parameters in the first part of the codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the network flow model, it is assumed that each task should demands at least 1 hour. If we look at the results, we may notice that time taken for each task is imbalanced (ex. DOL works for 25 hours on task 11 , but DOL works for 0 or 1 hour on other tasks). In the reality, one person should not concentrate all of their time on a specific task, and should distribute their effort. To solve this problem, we can extend the network flow model by converting it into a MIP for additional constraints. Doing so allows us to use indicator variables corresponding to each arc variable (from persons to tasks). Then we can use the same idea suggested in the section 2 MIP model: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $Z_{doer,task}$ is a binary variable that defines if the task will be done by the doer \n",
    "2. $X_{doer,task}$ is a variable defines the amount of hours spent on each task by the doer\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of the new constraints is expressed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_{doer=1,task=2}$ $>= 5 \\times$ $Z_{doer=1,task=1}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The meaning of this constraint is that if task1 is done by doer1, task2 should be done for more than 5 hours by doer1. If we connect each task by using indicator variables like this example, we can get more balanced results for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incidence Flow Network\n",
    "The results for the max flow model are shown in the print statement below. Max flows in general are not unique, so the interpretation of this model is that we can feasibly satisfy the project constraints, while giving each division a maximum workload. As expected, the flows through all edges are integral since the costs and constraints are integral, and the incidence matrix is totally unimodular. Thus, each division can expect to put in a full 30 units of effort towards the project. This particular max flow seems to concentrate workers on a few tasks. The DOL division spends most effort on task 13, the TAT division spends most effort on task 20, the DAV division spends all but 2 units of effort on task 28, and the JOJ division spends most effort on task 5. Most of the extra effort seems to end up in aesthetics, which is allocated nearly 400% of its minimum effort requirement."

    "The results flows chosen for the joint model are shown in the print statement below. Probably the first notable aspect of the result is that the flows chosen are no longer integral. Similarly, the longest path is no longer integral. Its length is 46.05... This is because the modified weights are non-integral after dividing the baseline by the flow. The next striking aspect of this result is that each division sends nonzero flow to *every possible task!* Each division has 10 task capabilities, and in this model, they will allocate effort to each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this result is as follows. Consider a simple version of the longest path problem with only two edges, $(s,u)$ and $(u,t)$. The edges have weights $C/x$ and $C/y$ respectively. We get to choose $x$ and $y$ to be any positive real as long as we satisfy the constraint $x+y=k$. Then we wish to minimize the longest path computed as $C/x + C/y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through elementary operations, $C/x + C/y = \\frac{Cy + Cx}{xy} = \\frac{C(y + x)}{xy}$. Then since $y+x=k$, this expression is just $\\frac{Ck}{xy}$. Thus, we wish to choose $x,y$ to maximize $x*y$; this is when $x=y$, which follows from the AM-GM inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see from this toy example, that it is better to \"distribute\" the total flow available through as many edges in a critical path as possible, rather than concentrating it on a few nodes. This helps us to see why the optimal solution sends at least a small amount of flow through each available edge."

    "#### Transportation Models\n",
    "Transportation models proved to be an effective way of modeling how to distribute work to complete the project. Application of individual specialization proved not have a significant effect on the outcome of the project, at least for the relatively wide specialization that is reasonable for a class project. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### MIP Model\n",
    "The MIP application of the problem is an effective way of modeling discrete decisions like assignment of task to people. In real world application;in any industries or any project, we would like to have a balance between cross trained staff and optimal number of people work in certain process with maximum profit or reward. MIP model will allow us to model those discrete decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow/Path/Combined Models\n",
    "The flow model can be implemented in either an incidence matrix or arc-variable form acceptably. One seems to require more constraints, the other takes more parameters. Perturbing the constraints seems to not have much of an effect on the max flows because the minimum capacity requirements were relaxed to begin with. The combined model allows us to jointly optimize the objectives of maximizing worker utilization and minimizing lead time through a convex formulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application\n",
    "There's an extremely interesting application of the result from the transportation analysis given in section 5.A:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not particularly difficult to create a statistical function that describes the expected number of unique tasks given the number of tasks each person can complete and the number of total tasks. This is a pretty straightforward application of probability theory, very similar to the \"Birthday Problem\". Using this function, it should be possible to derive an expression relating the degree of specialization (avg task proficiency / number of tasks) to the sensitivity of the objective. There may be a neat, mathematical approach to doing so, but a brute force approach would be to simply run various combinations of specialization and tasks through our program and determine the objective result. Then we'd just fit a curve to this relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why this is interesting: suppose you own a business where certain employees are specialized to tasks that are worth a certain amount of revenue. In cases where there's low crosstraining, certain individuals are huge liabilities for loss in the case of illness, quitting, and the like. This is an extremely common, real life scenario. Cutting to the chase, this concept could be an excellent way to model a business's [Bus Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)! This potential model would be a huge asset in risk management, revealing risky employees and identifying areas for crosstraining or hiring."

    "In class, we briefly discussed the example of geometric programming, where a nonconvex problem could be transformed into an equivalent convex problem through a convenient change of variables. This problem almost looks like a geometric program (GP) and if we can get it to fit that paradigm, we will have an easy way to transform it into a convex problem. More specifically, solvers for GP problems are really, really fast. We will develop some of the fundamental ideas of geometric programming briefly here to provide context for techniques considered and used beyond the scope of the class.\n",

    "In this brief discussion, we see that it is crucial for the variables to be positive because the $\\log$ function is undefined at 0. In our model, $\\nu$ is a free variable. If we can get it to be strictly positive, we may have a chance at formulating the problem as a geometric program. The constraint $$(A^{path})^{T}\\nu - \\sum_{i,j\\in N_{p}}(C_{ij}/x^{flow}_{j+44})\\geq 0$$ implies that $(A^{path})^{T}\\nu \\geq \\sum_{i,j\\in N_{p}}(C_{ij}/x^{flow}_{j+44})$. In turn, since each $C_{ij}$ is nonzero, each $\\nu$ must be nonzero; however, we cannot write it as a geometric program, because the matrix $A^{path}$ has negative entries, and in a geometric program, monomials and posynomials must have positive coefficients. Even if we expand our focus to the class of [mixed linear geometric programs](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/gp_tutorial.html) where we are allowed to mix geometric and affine constraints, we run into a similar issue where geometric variables are forced to take on negative coefficients.
